# BibKG_Wikidata Linker

BibKG_Wikidata Linker is an initiative developed by Jorge Cerda, and guided by Professor Aidan Hogan. 
The project comprises a collection of methods created to establish a connection between [BibKG](https://bibkg.imfd.cl/), a knowledge graph centered around academic publications in the domain of computer science, and Wikidata, linking equivalent entities between both data sources.

The main objective of this project is to establish direct links between entities in BibKG and Wikidata, providing researchers with a reliable connection to a broader knowledge ecosystem. This integration unlocks a wealth of possibilities for analysis, cross-referencing, and gaining enriched insights, enabling researchers to explore academic publications in the field of computer science with a more comprehensive understanding.

Additionally, this project aims to expand the range of information accessible within BibKG, presenting an array of potential enhancements for the future. For example, with the data from Wikidata entities BibKG could incorporate external IDs from diverse data sources previously unavailable. 

The continuous growth and enrichment of BibKG will significantly augment the amount of information accessible to researchers, providing them with robust and extensive resources for their scholarly endeavors.

# Getting started
